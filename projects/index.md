I am an enthusiast of open source. I literally open sourced every line of code that I wrote for my self. Also, I am a contributor of **Angular.js**, **Atom**, and a bunch of other open source projects.

Below are some projects that I think are interesting.

### node-stringify ([source](https://github.com/fuqcool/node-stringify))
A npm package to stringify almost any type of javascript object. And the output can be `eval`ed directly to get the original object.

### BlueOS ([source](https://github.com/fuqcool/blueos))
This is a beautiful toy that I and my friend Yang Ye made for CS5610(Web development). We implemented an Operating System in the browser, with our passion. This is so amazing that I believe it is the best ever course project in the history of CS5610.

### x-click ([source](https://github.com/fuqcool/X-Click))
A jquery plugin for asynchronous button click.

### emacs-settings ([source](https://github.com/fuqcool/emacs-setting))
My emacs configuration. Make sure that I can get my personal emacs env easily on a new computer.

### atom-emacs-mode ([source](https://github.com/fuqcool/atom-emacs-mode))
An atom extension that mimics emacs.
